      library: {
        text: `<h1>Welcome to the Library</h1><p>Known as the Daughter of the Ganatantra Mandap, Rashtrapati Bhavan's Library’ is located at the north-eastern corner of the Bhavan and is accessed through the north staircase. “A circle within a square”, it is said to resemble St Stephen’s Walbrook in London. The Rashtrapati Bhavan library, though a square, is given a circular character by the dome above it, which is supported by eight arches. The Library was built to hold book shelves that were sixty feet high and could fit the corners at right angles. The book shelves, that store a collection of thirty-three thousand books, including two thousand rare books, run along the walls of the library and are not restricted to the corners alone. The oldest book of the Library, A Catalogue of the Original Works of William Hogarth was published in 1795. The twelve pillars that are embellished with the Delhi Order bells on their top make an inner square. Oil on canvas paintings, <i>The Creation of Man</i> and <i>Invention of the Printing Press</i>, adorned with gold leaf frames are placed above the two fireplaces in the library.</p>`,

      hall: {
        text: `<h1>Step into the Gantantra Mandap</h1><p>Gantantra Mandap (formerly: Durbar Hall) is situated directly under the double-dome of the main building. Known as the Throne Room before independence, it had two separate thrones for the Viceroy and Vicereine. Since Indian Independence, a single high chair for the President is kept here under a Belgian glass chandelier hanging from a height of 33 m. The flooring of the hall is made of chocolate-coloured Italian marble. The columns in Gantantra Mandap are made in Delhi Order which combines vertical lines with the motif of a bell. The vertical lines from the column were also used in the frieze around the room, which could not have been done with one of the traditional Greek orders of columns. The columns are made from yellow Jaisalmer marble, with a thick line running along the centre.</p><p>Gantantra Mandap has a capacity of 500 people and it is here in this building that Jawaharlal Nehru took the oath of office of Prime Minister from Lord Mountbatten at 8.30 am on 15 August 1947.</p>`,

        text: `<h1>Banquet Hall</h1><p>The Banquet Hall at Rashtrapati Bhavan, also called the State Dining Room, is a grand 104-foot-long space overlooking Amrit Udyan. Adorned with Burmese teak paneling, 28 teak pilasters, and zardozi panels with gold and silver threads, it epitomizes artistic wealth. The hall features chandeliers, gold-framed oil paintings of Indian Presidents, and a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. Seating 104 guests, it hosts presidential banquets with meticulous service. Unique protocols include discreet light signals for meal stages and red rose vases to mark vegetarian diners. A musician's gallery adds charm, while the venue reflects Rashtrapati Bhavan’s rich cultural and ceremonial legacy.</p>`,
